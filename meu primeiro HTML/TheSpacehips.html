  <h3>Space Exploration Tecnologies Corp.</h3>
  <p>The Space Exploration Technologies Corporation, commonly referred to as SpaceX[9] is an American spacecraft manufacturer, launcher, and satellite communications company headquartered in Hawthorne, California. It was founded in 2002 by Elon Musk with the goal of reducing space transportation costs to colonization of Mars. The company manufactures the Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy, and Starship heavy-lift launch vehicles as well as rocket engines, the Cargo Dragon and Crew Dragon spacecraft; and the Starlink mega-constellation satellite. </p>
  <p>SpaceX offers commercial satellite-based internet service via its constellation of Starlink satellites, which became the largest-ever satellite constellation in January 2020 and as of December 2022 comprised more than 3,300 small satellites in orbit.[10]

    The company is also developing Starship, a privately funded, fully reusable, super heavy-lift launch system for interplanetary and orbital spaceflight. It is intended to become SpaceX's primary orbital vehicle, supplanting the existing Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy, and Dragon fleet. In April 2023, the first flight of Starship made it the largest and most powerful rocket ever flown; the flight ended in an explosion four minutes after launch.</p>
  <p>SpaceX is the first private company to develop a liquid-propellant rocket that has reached orbit; to launch, orbit, and recover a spacecraft; to send a spacecraft to the International Space Station; and to send astronauts to orbit and to the International Space Station. It is also the first organization of any type to achieve vertical propulsive landing of an orbital rocket booster and the first to reuse such a booster. SpaceX's Falcon 9 rockets have landed and reflown more than 150 times.</p>
